# FHelper

This project intents to implement a finance companion built in [Flutter](flutter.dev), utilizing the new [Material Design 3 (Material You)](m3.material.io).

## **FLUTTER VERSION NOTICE**
- FHelper **will not update from Flutter 3.12 (beta)**.
   
An migration to Flutter stable it's in analysis.

Note 1: FHelper will only be updated if it is necessary (security flaw or major bug).  
Note 2: FHelper will receive pre-release updates (0.0.0-xxxx), but won't voluntarily update to Flutter 3.13.
## Getting Started

Today (as of 21/6/2023), FHelper is only tested on Flutter beta 3.12 (specfically 3.12.0-1.1.pre), being the recommended version for development (for now).   
**Any other version will not receive support.**

### - "Why beta? Are you crazy?"

Material You support wasn't available on stable until Flutter 3.10 (released on 10/5/2023).  
Since this project was created before that, it heavily relies on MD3 support present in beta.

That said, even stable versions of FHelper might not be as stable, as the Flutter used is not for production, but 
even then **stable versions are solid enough for daily driving**.
