# fhelper

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project intents to implement a finance companion built in [Flutter](flutter.dev).

It utilizes the new [Material Design 3 (Material You)](m3.material.io).
Since Flutter support for MD3 isn't fully stable (as of 27/5/2023), **it is recommended to use Flutter beta** (tested with 3.11.0-0.1.pre). 

Flutter 3.10 stable still have visual bugs, text clipping and missing features similar with the 3.10 beta.
Still it has Dart 3 stable support, so code compatibility is, at least, "assured".
**Try on your on**

### Dart 3 notice

Flutter 3.11 (beta) comes bundled with Dart 3.1 (3.1.0-63.1.beta).
Dart beta features at not expected, but
**Specific features from Dart 3 (stable) are expected to be implemented.**
